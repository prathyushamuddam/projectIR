Description?

I named this  PHP project  "sqsearch" due to its functionality. The system is mainly developed to collect spoken and written queries.
Simplily description about the pages as below.
spoken.php:	---	"start":start record voice and speech recognize function.
		---	"stop": stop to record the audio
		---	"search": search query user spoked
		---	"record": start record voice.
witten.php:	---	collect written queries.

*Just record voice and don't recognize speech to text: "record", "stop"
*the collected quries was stored in "uploads" folder.

Till now, what have been done?
